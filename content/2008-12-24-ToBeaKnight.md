ToBeaKnight

  


刚看了The Dark Knight(Batman)的高清版，虽然剧情什么的跟其它英雄片一样比较水，但仍然是部好电影，不枉我留作圣诞大餐啊。




贴些彰显骑士精神的对话，I‘ve learned why the knight is called "knight", not a "kday".




Alfred：Endure, Master Wayne. Take it. They'll hate you for it,  
but that's the point of Batman.  
He can be the outcast. He can make the choice that no one else can make.




The right choice.




BRUCE: No, today I found out what Batman can't do. He can't endure this.




----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




GORDON: They'll hunt you.




BATMAN: You'll hunt me. You'll condemn me.




Set the dogs on me. Because that's what needs to happen.




Because sometimes..... the truth isn 't good enough. Sometimes people deserve more.




Sometimes people deserve to have their faith rewarded.
